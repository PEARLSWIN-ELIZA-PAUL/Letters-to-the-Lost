Dear you,

I've been carrying this letter around in my head for months. Sometimes I think writing to you is madness - you hurt me, you changed my life - but the truth is, not writing has been worse.
you stabbed me.

There isn't a poetic way to say that. One second we were shouting, the next there was this flash of metal, a burning pain, and then the world just... went quiet. I remember looking down and not believing it was real. I remember your face - the shock, the panic. I don't think you meant for it to go that far. But it did.

I should hate you.
For a long time, I did.

I hated you through every hospital night, every stitch, every panic attack when someone walked too close behind me. I hated you when I looked at my mum's face, pale and broken, when she first saw the scar. I hated you most when I realised how much fear had moved into my body - fear of crowds, fear of being outside, fear of living.

ut hate is heavy. It eats you slowly. And I was tired of carrying it.
So, I started to heal. Not just the wound, but everything underneath it. I went to therapy. I talked. I cried. I screamed into pillows when no one was around. And somewhere in all that noise, I found something unexpected - a tiny bit of understanding.

You were scared too, weren't you? That's what all this comes down to - fear. You thought you needed a knife to survive, the same lie we've all been fed for years. That night, fear met fear, and one of us didn't walk away the same.

I can't excuse what you did. You took something from me that I'll never fully get back. But I can choose what to do with what's left.

So, I'm choosing to forgive you. Not because you deserve it, but because I do.

Forgiveness doesn't mean forgetting. It means I won't let that moment define every part of me anymore. It means I can look in the mirror and see more than the scar. It means I can talk about it without shaking.

I don't know where you are now. Maybe in prison. Maybe trying to change. Maybe pretending it never happened. I hope you find peace one day, the kind that doesn't come from fear or control, but from facing what you did and being better than that moment.

Because that's what I'm trying to do too - be better than that moment. I survived. That's something neither of us can take away.
So here it is - my letter, my release. I forgive you.

Not for you.
For me.

-A  survivor
