Dear my students past, present, and the ones I've lost,

It's nearly midnight and the school corridors are quiet again. The cleaners have gone home, the lights are off, but I can't leave yet. I keep sitting here, staring at the empty chairs in my classroom, counting the faces that should still be in them.

There are too many empty chairs.

I became a teacher because I believed in stories. Every young person is a story waiting to be written full ofchapters that could go anywhere. I still believe that, even when the world outside these gates tries to write the ending for you.

Some mornings you came in laughing, still half-asleep, complaining about homework. Some mornings you came in angry, eyes heavy from things you'd seen the night before. I never judged you for it. I just wished I could protect you from everything waiting past the school gates.

I remember Kieron - always late, always loud, always first to help another kid who dropped their books. I remember Leanne, who could draw better than anyone I'd ever met. And I remember the phone calls. The ones that start with silence on the other end. The ones that end with, "There's been an incident."

Nothing prepares you for hearing that one of your kids has been taken by a knife. You can have all the training in the world, but nothing teaches you how to stand in front of a class the next morning and pretend it's going to be okay.

I still keep their exercise books. Their handwriting, their doodles, their dreams written in blue pen. One page says, "I want to be a mechanic." Another says, "I just want to make my mum proud." I keep them because I can't let the world forget who they were - not just names in a headline.

Sometimes people say, "It's not your job to fix it." Maybe not. But when you spend your days with these kids, watching them grow, hearing their laughter echo down the halls - you can't help but feel responsible when the laughter stops.

To the ones still here - please listen to me. You don't have to carry that blade. You don't have to prove anything. The real strength is walking away. The real bravery is choosing life when everything around you says you shouldn't care.

You are more than your postcode. More than your reputation. More than the fear that makes you think you need to be hard to survive.

Every time I lock my classroom door, I whisper a small prayer - that you all make it home safe. That tomorrow, you walk through that door again with your music too loud and your excuses ready. I'll take the noise. I'll take the chaos. Just give me the chance to keep seeing you alive.

With love and belief, Miss R.
