Dear whoever's reading this,

I never thought I'd be the type to write something like this. I've spent most of my life trying not to feel too much, trying not to remember too much. But lately, I've been thinking a lot about the people I've lost - faces that come back to me at night, voices I'll never hear again. Maybe writing this down is my way of keeping them alive.
I grew up in a place where carrying a knife wasn't seen as wrong. It was seen as wise. Everyone said it was for protection. "You never know who's out there," my older cousin used to say, tapping the handle in his pocket like it was just another part of his outfit.
At first, it felt normal. Then it became something darker.

By the time I was fifteen, I'd seen more blood than birthdays. I'd been chased, jumped, and once held a knife myself - shaking, sweating, trying to look brave when I was terrified inside. The streets don't care about fear though. Fear gets you hurt. Fear gets you killed. So, I learned to wear a mask. I learned to laugh when things got violent. I learned to say, "It's just how it is."

But it's not just how it is. That's what they tell you so you stop questioning it. The turning point for me - it wasn't one big moment. It was a collection of small,
painful ones. I lost my best mate, Aaron, when I was 17. He got caught up in something stupid - a fight that should've ended with words, not a blade. I remember seeing his mum at the hospital, begging the nurses, "Please, just save him." He didn't make it. And I remember thinking: that could've been me. It should have been me.

After that, I started seeing ghosts. Not the kind that haunt you from the outside - the kind that live inside you. Every time I walked past the place it happened, I heard his laugh. Every time I saw his brother, I felt that guilt.
One night, I just broke down. Proper broke down. I sat on my mum's kitchen floor, crying like a kid. I told her I was tired - tired of pretending, tired of losing people, tired of wondering when it'd be my turn. She didn't say much. Just held me, said, "You can still change, son. You're still here." That stuck with me.

It took time. It took distance. I left the area for a bit, got involved with a youth group, started helping younger lads who were like me - thinking knives made them strong. The first time one of them said, "I don't need it anymore," I swear it felt like breathing for the first time in years.

I still carry the memories, though. The funerals. The fear. The smell of hospital corridors. But I also carry something else - hope. The kind I never thought I'd find. I can't bring back the ones I've lost, but I can make sure their stories don't fade away. If you're reading this and you're caught up in that life - I get it. I really do. It's hard to see a way out when every road feels dangerous. But trust me, the bravest thing you'll ever do is walk away. Don't wait for a miracle. Be your own turning point.
For Aaron. For the boys who never made it home. And for the me who almost didn't.
-D.
