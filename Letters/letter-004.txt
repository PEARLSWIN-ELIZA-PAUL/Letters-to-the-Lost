Dear the one who took him,

I've started this letter a hundred times, crossed it out, thrown it away, started again. I don't even know if I'm angry or just empty anymore. But I need to say this - not because it will change anything, but because silence feels heavier than words.

You killed my best friend.

You probably didn't mean to. Maybe it was meant to scare him. Maybe you thought you were just "handling business." But whatever you thought that night - you were wrong. You didn't just take one life. You took his from all of us.

His name was Reece. You probably remember that. Everyone knew Reece - loud, kind, always cracking jokes even when things were rough. He was the glue in our group. The one who made sure we all got home safe. The one who'd lend you money he didn't have just to keep you smiling.

And now, he's gone.

You know what it's like now? Every birthday, every night out, every seat at the table - there's an empty chair where he should be. We still pour one out for him, still laugh about the stupid things he did, but the laughter doesn't sound the same. It's always missing something.

You gave us silence where his voice should've been.

I've pictured that night a thousand times. The argument. The knife. The way he probably said, "It's not that deep, bro," because he hated fighting. I hope you see his face every time you close your eyes. Not out of hate - but because I want you to understand the weight of what you did.

The thing that gets me the most? You and him weren't so different. Same background. Same struggle. Both just trying to survive a world that taught us to be scared, to act tough, to never back down. We all got caught up in that lie - that carrying a knife makes you safe. But it doesn't. It makes everything more dangerous, more final.

I used to wish the worst for you. I wanted you to feel what I felt - the loss, the pain, the hole in the chest that never heals. But hating you won't bring Reece back. And I think he'd hate me for holding onto that hate.

So, this is me trying to let go.

You took his life, but I won't let you take mine too - not the part of me that still believes people can change. I hope you do change. I hope you wake up every day and make choices that honour the life you took. Help someone. Talk to the kids who are where we were. Tell them it's not worth it.

Because if you stop even one person from picking up a knife, maybe - just maybe - Reece didn't die for nothing.

We still set a plate for him at Christmas. His mum still talks to his photo every morning. His little sister still asks when he's coming back.

He's not.
But you are still here.
So do something with that.

- His friend.
