Dear whoever finds this,

I've rewritten this letter more times than I can count. Every time I start, the tears come before the words do. It's been three years since that night, but it still feels like yesterday.

The night my son didn't come home.

His name was Malik. Sixteen years old. He had the loudest laugh, the kind that filled the whole house. He loved chicken wings, hated maths, and always left his shoes in the hallway no matter how many times I told him not to. Just a normal boy. My boy.

That evening, he said, "Mum, I'll be back before nine."
I remember teasing him, "You'd better be. You've got school tomorrow." He smiled - that half grin of his - and shut the door.

It was the last time I saw him alive.

At 9:45, I started worrying. By 10:15, I was calling his phone over and over. It rang twice, then nothing. At 11, there was a knock at the door. When I opened it, I saw blue lights flashing behind the officer's face. I knew before he even spoke.

People talk about heartbreak like it's a figure of speech. It's not. It's physical. It's a pain in your chest that makes you forget how to breathe.

The weeks after were a blur - police statements, funeral arrangements, faces I didn't recognize hugging me, telling me they were sorry. The world kept moving, but mine just stopped. His room stayed the same for months. I'd sit on his bed and talk to him, like he could still hear me. I still do sometimes.

I found out later that it was a stupid argument. A fight over nothing. A knife pulled "just to scare," they said. But that's the thing about knives - once they're out, they don't care who gets hurt. One second you're trying to look tough; the next, someone's life is gone.

People ask me how I keep going. Truth is, some days I don't. Some days I just survive the hours until I can close my eyes and see him again in dreams. But other days - the good ones - I tell his story. I go to schools, community centres, anywhere they'll listen. I tell them about Malik's laugh, his heart, the way he used to say, "Mum, I'm gonna make you proud."

And even though he's gone, he still does.

If you're a young person reading this - please, I beg you, think about your mother before you pick up that knife. Think about the sound she'll make when she gets that call. Think about the hole you'll leave behind.

Knives don't protect you. They destroy everything you love.
I lost my son that night. But maybe, just maybe, his story can save someone else's. With love,
Malik's Mum
