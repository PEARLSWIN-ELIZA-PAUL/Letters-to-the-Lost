Dear whoever's reading,
Sometimes I still open the wardrobe and see his trainers lined up. Fresh creps, all cleaned and ready like he's about to come home and grab a pair before heading out. But he's not coming home - not for a long time.

My brother's name is Jayden. He was the kind of person everyone looked up to. He had this energy - loud, funny, fearless. When we were kids, I used to trail behind him everywhere. If he was out playing football, I was the little one carrying the ball. If he got into trouble, I'd be the one trying to copy him.

But somewhere along the way, things changed.

He started hanging with boys older than him, boys who always had something tucked in their waistband. I didn't know it then, but they were carrying knives. He'd come home later and later. Mum would cry; Dad would shout. And me - I just watched.

The first time I saw a knife on him, I froze. I must've been thirteen. He told me not to tell anyone. Said it was "just for safety." But how can something meant to protect you make everyone around you scared of you?

There were nights he came home with cuts and bruises. I'd sneak into his room to check if he was okay, but he'd just say, "Don't worry, lil bro, I'm good." He never was.

Then one day, he didn't come home at all.

We found out he'd been arrested. Someone got stabbed - not fatally, thank God - but Jayden was there. He said he didn't do it, but it didn't matter. Wrong place, wrong people, wrong life.

When I saw him in court, he looked small. Not the big brother who used to protect me. Just a scared kid in a suit that didn't fit, eyes down, hands shaking. I wanted to scream, "Why did you do this? Why did you throw everything away?" But when he turned and looked at me, I saw it - regret. Real, heavy regret.

He's serving six years now. I visit him when I can. We don't talk much about what happened. He always asks about Mum, about school, about if I'm keeping out of trouble. Last time, he said something I'll never forget.

He said, "Don't make my mistakes your story." So I won't.
I'm trying to do things differently. I study hard. I keep my circle small. I still wear his old shoes sometimes - the clean white Air Forces he left behind. Not to be like him, but to remember what happens when you think the streets care about you.

They don't.

If you've got an older brother, hug him. Tell him you love him, even if he acts too tough to hear it. Because one day, you might be standing in his room, looking at his shoes, wishing you'd said it sooner.

-L.
