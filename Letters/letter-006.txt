Dear the ends,

We grew up on these streets. Same blocks, same bus stops, same corner shops where we'd scrape coins together for a can of juice and a packet of crisps. Same sirens echoing at night. Same fear we pretended we didn't feel.

There were three of us - me, Jamal, and Rico.
We called ourselves brothers before we even knew what that word really meant.



From Me - (T):
I'm the one who got out. Somehow. I don't even know how. Maybe luck, maybe timing. I still walk past the park where we used to chill, where we'd talk about getting rich, moving Mum out the block. Back then it felt like we had all the time in the world.

But then the blades came out. Slowly at first.
At first, it was just "for protection:' Then it became part of us, like our phones or our shoes. Something we didn't leave the house without.

Rico was the first to get caught up. One night turned into a prison sentence.
Jamal - he never came back. One argument, one stab, one moment that none of us can take back. And me? I'm the one still here, trying to tell our story before the streets tell it for us.


From Rico - (written from prison):
When I read T's letter, I cried. Proper cried.
I used to think tears made you weak. Now I know what real weakness is - it's watching your life waste away behind bars while your mum gets older without you.

I think about that night all the time.
If I hadn't pulled the knife... if I'd just walked away... maybe Jamal would still be here. Maybe T wouldn't be out there carrying both our ghosts. I used to dream about being someone.
Now I just dream about being free. Not just free from this place - free from the mindset that made me think this was normal.

If you're reading this and you're carrying, put it down. Trust me. There's nothing brave about it. You'll either end up where I am, or where Jamal is. And neither place is worth it.



From Jamal - (written by T, for him):
If Jamal could talk, he'd probably laugh at us for getting all emotional. He'd say, "Man up, bro."But deep down, he was the softest out of all of us. Always smiling, always telling us to chill.
He didn't deserve to go out like that. None of them do. There's an empty seat whenever we link up now.
We pour one out, play his song, and it still doesn't feel right.



We used to say the streets raised us.
But the truth is - they only raised us to bury us.

Still, I believe in something better now.
I work with kids from the same blocks, telling them our story. I tell them about Jamal's laugh, Rico's regret, and the pain that never really leaves. If our story can stop even one kid from following the same road, then maybe all this hurt means something.
For Jamal.
For Rico.
For everyone the streets tried to take.

- T. (for all of us)
